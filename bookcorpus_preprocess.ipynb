      "53522 i didnt realise that this actually meant climbing up onto the belt , but still i apprehensively clambered aboard ; after all if it was safe enough for a tray of beans then it must be safe enough for me , and with a quick nod to marcel , and the press of a button we rose serenely up into the restaurant / cafeteria , or as i will from now on be referring to it as , the greenhouse .\n",
      "53549 they were in surprisingly good condition so on the spur of the moment i had decided to have them renovated , along with the shells of two offices / workshops / crew room complexes situated between them why i hadnt the faintest idea ; it just seemed like a good idea at the time .\n",
      "53558 it would house the offices , store rooms and restrooms , along with a sail loft , rigging shop for the dinghies , classroom / conference room and the duty boatmans office and bedroom .\n",
      "53594 the superstructure , with the exception of the flight deck will be constructed of aluminium alloys , instead of steel , to reduce top weight ( as hopefully there wouldnt be to many exocets arriving unannounced ) , and the open space between the bridge and the flight deck / hangar will be filled in ( there is no real requirement for torpedo tubes on a civilian ship ) , and the owner / guest accommodation located in it .\n",
      "53603 the open flying bridge , will be above that , and the sleek low funnel , which will be situated just aft of it , will be home to the two huge rr / northrop grumman engines exhausts .\n",

      "53835 i was , but only so that paul and i could test drive the next hole to be finished , and neither of us could wait for the course to be finally complete , especially as i had made a decision very early on in the process that the eighth hole / ninth tee would be on the island , and there would be no bridge to it , we would have to use special boats to get to and from it .\n",
      "53846 it was having the finishing touches done to a minor repair , and a colour change for its blue leather upholstery ( my eyes are green , it would clash ) , and i enjoyed wandering around watching their craftsmen lovingly restoring and / or constructing a host of other beautiful boats , no enough is enough .\n",
      "53855 the small permanent ships crew would be recruited by carol , but when the lady s was alongside at el campo they would come under the day to day supervision of the bosun , not only looking after the lady s but operating and tending all my other boats as well , but to enable the lady s to function safely at sea 24 / 7 , extra seamen ( and women ) would be purloined from the other departments around el campo , staff that wouldnt normally be going to sea ( security , ground staff etc ) .\n",
      "53864 every trainee , when he / she had passed the initial training stage was flown up to germany to acquaint them with the lady s in person , but if they thought it was going to be a holiday , think again , captain carter was turning into a very hard taskmistress .\n",

      "54063 in front of me was a very stout looking armoured door , with a fingerprint /  key pad to one side .\n",
      "54080 during those four days i had around four hundred visitors on board the lady s and not one piece of silverware went missing , and neither was one single sailor more than slightly merry on return to his / her ship - although my new table centrepiece was firmly locked away in the safe , just in case .\n",
      "54339 too late ladies im already taken - now that thought cheered me up , and that night / morning sandra and i fell asleep talking on the phone , and we were both shocked into consciousness by her blasted alarm clock ( she was definitely not bringing that with her to el campo ! )\n",
      "54341 the local shipyard had kindly offered me the use of their facilities , so the lady s was going to spend a few days in dry dock having her bottom touched up ( lucky thing ) and a few minor bits and bobs sorted out , although she had come through the whole experience virtually unscathed , just a few dents here and there , so after a shower and a very late breakfast ( id often had lunch earlier ) i went off to do the rounds of my crew , to thank them for their sterling efforts over the past few days and to hint that santa might just be coming early ( in their pay packets ) , but virtually to a man ( and / or woman ) they thanked me , but what they would really like was a small commemorative patch that they could wear on their uniforms , similar to the ctf 150 patches that some had already received .\n",
      "54406 following a brief time driving heavy goods vehicles i then spent a further fourteen years as a housing officer for a local authority / housing association before being medically retired .\n",

      "64615 as we slowly sipped our wine and / or zero alcohol beer and waited for our starters to arrive i casually mentioned to beryl that i had heard on the grapevine that she had been moaning to all and sundry about the crap organisation in my household , and that she thought she could do a better job herself , with one hand tied behind her back .\n",
      "64641 where the hawker hunter is concerned you really are spoilt for choice , so it was decisions , decisions , decisions , and what we finally settled on was that , subject to availability , the basic team would be made up of sixteen aircraft , twelve of them mark f6 single seater fighters ( or ga11 /  export equivalents ) and four two seater t7s or t8s , with , if we could get them , one of each as spares .\n",
      "64678 in the nick of time i remembered that : - ( a ) the ejection seat was not a zero / zero rated one ( zero forward speed /  zero height ) .\n",

      "64766 she then took over some of her mothers more strenuous jobs as she ( her mother that is ) wasnt getting any younger , and picked up a new one of her own , as part time office cleaner for the security firm that was looking after the old airfield , and when thomas ( a brummy security guard / ex-teacher ) started teaching his colleagues english she joined in with a vengeance , and so when mr michaels moved into his temporary accommodation on the airfield , inma quickly volunteered her services as cleaner , and suddenly found herself permanently employed as a maid .\n",
      "64797 then along came large black clouds in the shape of shiny new f / a-18 hornets , and as they started at arrive , to replace the venerable hunter , procedures started to change .\n",
      "64802 three weeks later a refuelling bowser found a patch of black ice and slid gracefully into another f58 ( everything concerning the hunter is graceful ) , impacting at the join between the left hand side of the cockpit and the left intake / wing , as the swiss navy didnt have shares in the hunter it was still left , and not port .\n",
      "64806 he was as proud as punch for what his men had achieved , but no one else on the airfield cared a jot , the new f / a-18s were arriving in force and the hunters were quickly becoming relics of the past .\n",
      "64807 as the stores department needed more room for the f / a-18s spares anything with a hunter reference number on it was deposited unceremoniously in the getting quite full hangar .\n",
      "64818 measure the length of the box / crate / item and multiply it by x francs , swings and roundabouts he said , thus hubby became the proud owner of things like a box of 24 not so practical sets of aircraft foul weather blanks for the same price as two completely refurbished undercarriage assemblies .\n",
      "64826 as he ( hubby ) was getting fairly close to retirement it was just not going to be cost effective for the air force to send him to america to retrain on the f / a-18s , would he consider early retirement ?\n",

      "64844 as we turned to leave i lifted the message pad off the crate and there it was p / n - h / 6537684 , the number that had so recently become etched in my brain , it wasnt a box , it was a bloody great crate .\n",
      "64865 she agreed that she didnt much care for her home / hangar , she was really a city bird at heart , so she readily agreed in principle ( and in writing ) that i could not only have the aircraft and all the spares , but that i could purchase her home / s as well .\n",

      "65025 not only one for each aircraft as plane captains ( so called , to instil a sense of pride / ownership in them ) , but others servicing the ground equipment , manning the stores / tool control cage and looking after the oils and fuel bowsers ( oops , i had forgot about them ) , but he didnt want them scrubbing and cleaning , except of course the aircraft .\n",
      "65037 if an aircraft landed with a problem with its engine he did not want a queue of specialists trying to fix it for the next week and a half , he wanted the plane captain , ( and a couple of the other captains whose aircraft were serviceable and tucked away in the shed ) , along with an electrician , a grubber ( airframes / engine ) and greenie ( electrical ) supervisor ready and waiting .\n",
      "65039 they would then slide the tail assembly back on , and after a second independent grubber had double checked the engine and flying control connections , a cross trained mechanic / tractor driver would tow it outside , under the supervision of any supervisor ( not just a specialist aircraft handler that had been sitting around waiting ) and the grubber supervisor ( or even the plane captain if hed had the extra training ) would then ground run the new engine to check it out ( but not when i am asleep - thank you very much ) .\n",
